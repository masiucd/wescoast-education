## About <a name = "about"></a>

A simple example of using a OOP design in Typescript.
How does the _new_ keyword works and how _this_ keyword is used when working with a more _OOP_ code paradigm.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

```bash
  $ git clone <URL>

  $ cd into project

  npm/yarn install

```

to run the code in the browser simply run

```bash
  $ npm run build-run
```

and refresh the page

## What is the `new` keyword doing for us when constructing a new object?

**The new keyword will insert a bunch of different stuff for us, 3 main things!**

- **this** will be bound to a empty object. Create a empty object and assign to this
- sets a hidden property which is **underscore underscore proto underscore underscore** sometime call _dunder proto_
- final thing it will automatically return out object from the function

## <a name = "proto" ></a> **\_\_proto\_\_\_**

What is going on when we call a method that does not exists on the object itself but we declared the method on the prototype like this:

```js
  function User(name.age){
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
  }

  const u1 = new User("bob",21)

  User.prototype.birthday = function(){
    this.age++
  }

```

You will probably think it will go straight forward to the prototype but that's not how Javascript works.
It will _panic_ for a bit when it can't find the method itself on the `u1` object.
Luckily javascript has something that calls `dunder proto` which then will go and check if the `birthday` method actually exists on the `User.prototype` and then call the `birthday method`.

[\_\_proto\_\_ vs prototype](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9959727/proto-vs-prototype-in-javascript)

**proto** is also automatically created when a function is created and that is o what JavaScript will use to look up methods it doesn't find immediately on the current prototype.

```js
function foo() {}

foo.name = "bar"
console.log(foo.name) // foo
foo.prototype.age = 21
console.log(foo.prototype) // foo {age:21}
```

If you want to get deeper on how `OOP` works in _Javascript_ I highly recommend to read [Kyle Simpsons](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

## Module pattern <a name = "module-pattern"></a>

Javascript does not have the typical 'private' and 'public' like the more popular OOP language like `java` ore `C#`. However, you can achieve the same effect using clojure's in javascript and `module pattern` using function-level scoping.
The Module pattern is a powerful tool to use to achieve the result that we want to hide or data(`data hiding`) layer like we do in `java` or `c#`.

The main goal is to hide all data until we really need to use the data.

To avoid exposing your top-level function to the global scope we wrap our function inside a `IFFE` **immediately-invoked function expression.**

Here is the score example:

```ts
export const game = (() => {
  let score = 0

  // Private
  const updateScore = (newScore: number) => {
    score = newScore
    const countTracker = document.getElementById(
      "count-tracker"
    ) as HTMLHeadingElement
    countTracker.innerHTML = ` <span>${score}</span> `
  }

  const increment = () => {
    updateScore(score + 1)
  }
  const decrement = () => {
    updateScore(score - 1)
  }

  const getScore = () => {
    console.log(score)
    return score
  }

  const newGame = () => updateScore(0)

  const startGame = () => {
    newGame()
  }

  // This will be a private method
  const somePrivateFunc = () => {
    console.log("SCORE", score)
  }

  /* Variables and functions that we would like to expose */
  return {
    score,
    increment,
    getScore,
    startGame,
    decrement,
    newGame,
  }
})()
```

we will keep our methods `public` ore `private` depending on how we want the structure/functionality to be.
For example the methods that gets return from the function will work as `public` methods while methods that are not return will work as a `private method`

## Model View Controller <a name = "mvc"></a>

MVC is a very common pattern for organizing your code.
It's used in different frameworks and it helps you to organize your code in a good way.

`MVC` stands for _Model - View - Controller_.

- **Model** Manages the data of an application
- **View** A visual representation of the model
- **Controller** works like the middleman that talks to the Model and View. You use the controller to access the View ore the Model. The View and Model can't talk each other.

The model is the data. handle the logic and methods that will make the UI change.

The view is how the data is displayed. Mount to the _DOM_ and renders the given `UI`.

The controller connects the model and the view.
The model never touches/talks to the view. The view never touches/talks to the model. The controller connects them and controls the together.
